In this python project, I have plot the google trends data to find out the most famous Kardashian/Jenner sister.

# Important libraries used

In pandas, I have worked with

   a) reading csv file
         
   b) datasets description, info
         
   c) to_string(), df[column name].str.replace() , pd.to_numeric(),
   
   pd.to_datetime(), df.set_index('column name'), df.loc[]
   
        
In matplotlib, I have worked with simple dataframe plotting.
